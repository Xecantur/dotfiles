2013-06-06 16:05:09	navigator	I know exactly what you mean
2013-06-06 16:05:36	Roukoswarf	also, planning paths of reactions people can have, like in a conversation, helps
2013-06-06 16:05:54	Roukoswarf	run through all possible reactions, how they impact what you say next
2013-06-06 16:06:17	navigator	I've spent hours trying to imagine what it is like to be other persons. To "have someones brain". To feel, THINK and react like they do. It's hard but you get better.
2013-06-06 16:06:36	Roukoswarf	i just do it by generalizations
2013-06-06 16:06:44	Roukoswarf	generalize, then tack on exceptions
2013-06-06 16:06:48	navigator	Roukoswarf: like a tree of "if that, say this"?

2013-06-06 16:08:40	Roukoswarf	navigator: well, what i do is gather as much info as possible initially, make assumptions on the type of person they are, since people often generally react the same if they appear to be the same type of person, then follow the best path you can see, and as you get to know them, tack on exceptions to the assumed type
2013-06-06 16:08:43	navigator	Roukoswarf: I bought an extra harddrive just to store a large database of conversations, to build "talk-maps" with. It's impractical and an aspie's way of looking at it.

2013-06-06 16:14:16	navigator	Roukoswarf: right. So if you see .. a punk rocker or something. Likelyness.. I like that idea. I've always thought: "either I'm sure, or I'm not"

2013-06-07 17:20:27	dsman195276	You could probably figure it out with a little bit of bash. Just look in /usr/share/fortune/, each fortune is just seperated via a '%' in the files.
2013-06-07 17:21:02	HectorAE	Hm sounds like an interesting scripting exercise
2013-06-07 17:21:42	dsman195276	I'm not 100% sure on the script you'd have to do (I'm not amazing at bash), but all the files in /usr/share/fortune not ending in '.dat' are plain text with all the fortunes inside. It would be a bit interesting to know.

2013-06-07 17:38:57	HectorAE	We should put that in the fortunes
2013-06-07 17:39:18	dsman195276	I kinda feel like 5 of the fortunes should be removed so the number can end in 42...
2013-06-07 17:39:27	HectorAE	I bet nobody would ever suspect it wasn't from #debian if we put it in there
2013-06-07 17:39:31	nathan28	taotetek: don't start

2013-06-08 18:03:29	azriel	jqvillanova: your not buying it for the hardware your buying it as a software distribution system
2013-06-08 18:03:59	azriel	similar in context to the official repo ( except that a repo here is equivalent to a retailer )

2013-06-08 18:05:40	jqvillanova	I agree with you in some points you made

2013-06-08 18:06:04	azriel	if you'll notice they've mostly relied on outdated hardware
2013-06-08 18:06:47	azriel	if they used the latest and greatest I bet you the next gen systems would cost 3-4$ dollars and games would be 150-200$

2013-06-08 19:33:31	brotatos	I just have to focus on getting over her.
2013-06-08 19:33:33	brotatos	She's moved on.
2013-06-08 19:33:41	brotatos	It's a long story that I don't want to explain.
2013-06-08 19:33:49	brotatos	She recently started seeing someone new this month.
2013-06-08 19:34:01	brotatos	And for some reason that manifested really strong feelings from me to her.
2013-06-08 19:34:08	brotatos	I wanted to get back together with her.
2013-06-08 19:34:16	brotatos	Today, she cut contact from me to give myself time to heal.
