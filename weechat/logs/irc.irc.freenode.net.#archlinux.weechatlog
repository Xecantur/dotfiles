One day preparing a play list in one of my terminal windows i forgot to specify --novideo and to my surprise it began to play an ascii,how awesome is that?! Upon further research i discovered its because of the aa lib, however that leads to another problem. while mplayer can play videos on my computer just fine this way, when i run it
2013-06-05 22:32:18	Asad3ainJalout	through youtbube-viewer it only shows a small thin vertical slice of the video. Any suggestions? Thank you for the help.

2013-06-05 23:19:24	Asad3ainJalout	otherwise, it will kill you if you wear those same clothes

2013-06-06 10:11:39	ovidiu-florin	d_garbage: the error: I'm using KDE, and whe I plug in the USB key, I see two drives, instead of one. I can mount only one of them. The first one, labeled: ARCH_201306 and the second one, labeled: Kingston DT 101 G2. If I mount using: mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb it mounts the first one. if I mount the second one (from KDE gui) I see directories from the iso. I think the restore command did not work 100% exactly as it should have.

2013-06-06 11:18:51	mudkipz	the thing is I didn't have that compiz-decorator-gtk installed before because it included pulseaudio (which I didn't use). I'm testing some things now and installed pulseaudio. I'm trying to figure out what else was in that group so that I can grab the old packages from teh svntogit page.

2013-06-06 15:48:37	duhblow7	i followed the guide for the filesystem upgrade.  on step 1 it says " Fix any non-official packages with files in /bin, /sbin or /usr/sbin to put those files in /usr/bin.".  Define the word fix.  I removed them. It included grub.  I rebooted and it obviously won't reboot because I don't have grub anymore.  What does fix mean?  reinstall?  pacman --help lists no "fix" as an option.

2013-06-06 15:53:03	weirddan455	duhblow7, and dmcrypt + LUKS is a piece of cake.  I'm running full system encryption and it only took like 3 commands to set up.

2013-06-06 15:53:24	Aelius	i should probably just install grub2
2013-06-06 15:53:34	Jesin	sledgehammer: so, I cannot use pinentry on a system that does not have gtk2 installed, using the default setup

2013-06-06 15:53:51	velcroshooz	duhblow7: initscripts/sysvinit is no longer supporte, you should be running systemd at this point. so removing that was fine, assuming you have systemd properly setup.

2013-06-06 20:06:41	bezerker	Yeah. Friend was doing it like that similarly but I mess with my box too much to trust my net connectivity to it :)
2013-06-06 20:07:01	n00btr0ll	bezerker: that's my old box...new box has arch and im contemplating going to bsd and run arch in a vm

2013-06-06 20:07:21	bezerker	i did initially set it up just as a mass storage/fileserving/sickbeard+sabnzbd+couchpotato/media server box... but it turned into a kvm/lxc virtualization box as well
2013-06-06 20:07:24	n00btr0ll	jqvillanova: if i could
2013-06-06 20:07:36	bezerker	threw newznab on there too
2013-06-06 20:07:58	bezerker	eventuall will move my pbx over to it but for now that's on my ancient p3 that hasn't been updated since the dawn of time and I'm waiting for a root. :P
2013-06-06 20:08:10	n00btr0ll	bezerker: haha..i'm hoping to store my vms there too...zfs/nfs everything
2013-06-06 20:08:39	bezerker	n00btr0ll: it works surprisingly well depending on the hardware. Arch is a very good OS for it because everything is so up to date and not mangled by the distro maintainer.

2013-06-06 20:08:56	bezerker	n00btr0ll: Only thing that is semi annoying is the kernel updates. You can use lts kernel or just ignore kernel updates until you need to update
2013-06-06 20:08:56	n00btr0ll	it's alot of time though...might as well spend $500 to get similar setup done
2013-06-06 20:09:01	jqvillanova	That's true phrik

2013-06-06 20:09:12	ctruett	bah.
2013-06-06 20:09:37	bezerker	not too much time.  Wiki is pretty fairly accurate.  I anticipated more issues running server level items than I actually ran into.
2013-06-06 20:10:14	bezerker	I'd imagine getting some of these things to run under bsd would be more difficult. (I used to be a freebsd zealot back in the day.)
2013-06-06 20:10:19	n00btr0ll	bezerker: i had kernel update issues when i had my partioning messed up i.e /boot and /boot/efi in different partitions...all my kernel updates with arch had been non-disruptive...

2013-06-06 20:11:02	Firefishe	When using an arch install cd to "rescue" a system, what is the command for mounting the h/d system root directory?
2013-06-06 20:11:16	n00btr0ll	bezerker: hopefully im not a zealot..im actually thinking of solaris11 too - but hardware support is an issue...not that my hardware is that bad - i try picking things carefully
2013-06-06 20:11:17	ctruett	was it archroot or something like that?
2013-06-06 20:11:22	bezerker	n00btr0ll: The only kernel issue is the frequency of it. For a system you don't want to reboot it gets tiresome to update the kernel. And due to the way the linux package is handled, it blows away the old modules for your running kernel (thus starting kvm virtuals fails etc until you reboot into the new kernel etc)

2013-06-06 20:15:07	bezerker	Arch for a server... depends on your use case.  I like updated packages, and rolling release so I never have to worry about dist upgrading
2013-06-06 20:15:34	n00btr0ll	bezerker: i like rolling updates too...but like you said, it's a lazy man's server, no touching it for months
2013-06-06 20:15:43	bezerker	I get my small panic fears in small reboot update increments (take the recent filesystem update as an example) rather than a "i just replaced the EVERYTHING lets see what breaks:)" distro

2013-06-07 01:47:01	koentje	if you want though you can run the long offline test, it might give you more information. For the errors that it does show it's striking that it always happends after the same commands, maybe you could use that if you want to do further troubleshooting. But personally I wouldn't and I would regard the disk as broken

2013-06-07 13:23:24	switching	hello all, i've been trying ubuntu for like 6 months and am ready to try other distros.  What level of experience is necessary to successfully get through the beginner's guide, and would it be advisable to try archbang first?
2013-06-07 13:23:30	switching	or another distro?
2013-06-07 13:23:43	switching	also how does ndiswrapper work with arch?
2013-06-07 13:23:46	GermainZ	switching, are you an experienced reader?
2013-06-07 13:23:51	demize	switching: You don't really need any experience in particular as long as you read and learn stuff you don't know.

2013-06-08 06:14:58	Paul92	hi. I've updated my system and i had some conflicts with filesystem. I manage to solve them by using pacman -Syu --ignore filesystem and after that I updated filesystem separately. pacman -Syu told me that everything was updated. After reobot, it says that can't find root device, drops me in a recovery shell, and says "sh: can't acess tty: job control turned off". Also, I can't use my keyboard at all (I can't even turn on/off the leds). What can I do?

2013-06-08 17:56:14	jqvillanova	sudokode: Sega Saturn outplayed PLaystation in hardware, but it was plenty more difficult to develop
2013-06-08 17:56:34	sudokode	that's because nintendo worked with sony to develop it
2013-06-08 17:56:35	azriel	I mean seriously you have to connect to the internet once every 24 hours wth kinda bs is that

2013-06-08 17:57:30	sudokode	sony teamed up with nintendo for that
2013-06-08 17:57:35	sudokode	and then it kinda switched around
2013-06-08 17:57:36	jqvillanova	But nintendo found that phillips could did the job for less money than SOny, so they ditch Sony

2013-06-08 21:47:09	mistersprinkles	I <3 Arch. The transition from Fedora was actually easy as hell and so far Arch is just amazing. Runs beautiful. Not to mention the amount of stuff in the Arch repo and AUR is incredible.
2013-06-08 21:47:11	kaictl	d_garbage: i tried it with no config, and with the xorg.conf that the author says to use.

2013-06-08 21:47:14	kaictl	still no luck.
